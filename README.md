Node/ Express js Employee Compatibility Finder

I created an employee compatibility finder site. The user can fill out a simple survey and based off of their scores, it will match them with other users with similar interests.

Getting Started
Click this URL to navigate to the site on Heroku: https://gentle-coast-15380.herokuapp.com/

Using the Site
Once you have navigated to the home page, click on the blue "Go to Survey" button on the bottom left of the jumbotron. You will be taken to the survey page and required to fill in your name and provide a URL to an image of yourself. If you don't want to post your picture you can simply add random text into this field to bypass it.

Read the questions carefully and click on the drop-down box and select the answer that best fits you (1 Strongly Disagree and 5 Strongly Agree). Once finished click on the submit button and the character with the best match to your answers will be displayed on a popup modal.

Built With
HTML and Bootstrap- For the structure and VERY basic design of the user interface
jQuery- A popular JavaScript library used for the logic of capturing the user inputs and finding the best match based on scores
Node.js- An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser
Express.js- A web application framework for Node.js. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.
